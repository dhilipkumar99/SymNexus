## Channel Management

The admin panel gives you visibility into all channels, including private ones, and lets you archive or delete channels that are no longer needed.

## Viewing All Channels

From the admin panel at `/admin`, navigate to the **Channels** section. You will see every channel in the system, including:

- **Public channels** that anyone can join.
- **Private channels** that are normally hidden from non-members.
- **Archived channels** shown with a visual indicator.

For each channel, the list displays the name, type (public/private), member count, owner, and creation date.

## Channel Ownership

The user who creates a channel is its **owner**. Ownership grants:

- Everything a moderator of the channel can do: deleting anyone's message, removing members, archiving and unarchiving.
- Appointing moderators of the channel, and making them members again.
- Removing a moderator, which moderators cannot do to one another.

Any member who is not a guest can edit the channel's settings and add people to it; that is not reserved to the owner. Nobody can remove the owner.

Admins can perform all owner actions on any channel, regardless of ownership, except removing the owner.

## Archiving and Unarchiving

Archiving a channel puts it into **read-only mode**. Members can still access and read the full message history, but no new messages, reactions, or file uploads are allowed.

To archive a channel from the admin panel:

1. Open the admin panel at `/admin`.
2. Navigate to **Channels**.
3. Find the channel and open its action menu.
4. Select **Archive**.

To unarchive, follow the same steps and select **Unarchive**. The channel returns to full read-write mode immediately.

Archiving is useful when a project ends or a channel is no longer active but the conversation history should be preserved.

## Deleting Channels

Deleting a channel removes it and all its messages from the system. This action cannot be undone.

To delete a channel:

1. Open the admin panel at `/admin`.
2. Navigate to **Channels**.
3. Find the channel and open its action menu.
4. Select **Delete** and confirm the action.

Channel deletions are recorded in the [audit log](audit-log.md).

Only admins can delete channels. Channel owners who are not admins can archive but not delete.

## API

You can manage channels programmatically through the admin API. All admin endpoints require a valid JWT with the **admin** role.
