## API Reference

Burst exposes a RESTful API for all messaging operations. The OpenAPI specification at `specs/burst-api.yaml` is the single source of truth for endpoints, request/response schemas, and Barbacane gateway configuration.

## Base URL

All API requests go through the Barbacane gateway. The base URL depends on your deployment:

```
https://gateway.example.com
```

Do not send requests directly to the Burst backend. The gateway handles authentication, rate limiting, and ACL enforcement before forwarding requests.

## Authentication

Every request must include a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

The token is issued by your identity provider and validated by Barbacane's `oidc-auth` plugin. See [OIDC & SSO](../admin/oidc.md) for setup details.

## Pagination

All list endpoints use **cursor-based pagination** with UUIDv7 cursors. This provides stable results even when new items are created between page requests.

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `cursor` | The `nextCursor` value from the previous response. Omit for the first page. |
| `limit` | Items per page. Defaults to 50, maximum 100. |

**Response envelope:**

```json
{
  "data": [ ... ],
  "pagination": {
    "nextCursor": "msg_018f3e..."
  }
}
```

When `nextCursor` is `null`, there are no more pages.

## Error Format

Burst returns errors as [RFC 9457 Problem Details](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457) objects:

```json
{
  "type": "urn:burst:error:not-found",
  "title": "Not Found",
  "status": 404,
  "detail": "Channel ch_018f3e... does not exist."
}
```

The `type` field is a stable URN you can match on programmatically. Common error types:

| URN | Status | Meaning |
|-----|--------|---------|
| `urn:burst:error:not-found` | 404 | The requested resource does not exist. |
| `urn:burst:error:validation` | 422 | The request body failed validation. |
| `urn:burst:error:forbidden` | 403 | You do not have permission for this action. |
| `urn:burst:error:conflict` | 409 | The resource already exists or the operation conflicts. |
| `urn:burst:error:rate-limited` | 429 | Too many requests. Retry after the indicated delay. |
