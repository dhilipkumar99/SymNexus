## [0.2.0](https://github.com/barbacane-dev/burst/compare/v0.1.1...v0.2.0) (2026-09-29)


### Bug Fixes

* **ui:** show custom emojis as images in reactions and message text ([#11](https://github.com/barbacane-dev/burst/issues/11)) ([349da05](https://github.com/barbacane-dev/burst/commit/349da05cf1b5ecede3eccd22a11eda7d3d50c1d3))


### Continuous Integration

* release with release-please ([da04481](https://github.com/barbacane-dev/burst/commit/da04481e6b62ccb40dcb0fa215124054d5f827c8))

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-28

Custom emoji images load, and an API path no operation matches is a 404 rather than an SPA lookup. Chart 0.1.3.

### Fixed
- Custom emoji images load. A custom emoji's image was stored, but no route served it: the UI asked for `/api/attachments/emojis/<id>.<ext>`, which matched no operation and fell through to the SPA route. `GET /api/emojis/{emojiId}/image` serves it to any signed-in user (with `nosniff` and a sandboxing CSP, since SVG is accepted), and a CustomEmoji's `imageUrl` is that path. Deleting an emoji also deletes its image.
- A GET on an `/api/` path that no operation matches answers 404 with a problem document, instead of being looked up as an SPA file.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-28

The v1.0 scope: people and roles in channels, mentions that reach who they address, search filters, custom status, do not disturb and an admin data export. Burst also installs on Kubernetes with a Helm chart routed by the Gateway API, and runs on Barbacane 0.12.2.

### Added
- **Kubernetes**: a Helm chart (`deploy/helm/burst`, published to `oci://ghcr.io/barbacane-dev/charts/burst`) with the Barbacane gateway, the web image, PostgreSQL or an existing database, local or S3 storage, a Gateway API `HTTPRoute`, a NetworkPolicy and an optional ServiceMonitor. It needs Kubernetes 1.30 or later. The `burst-gateway` image carries Barbacane with the compiled artifacts. (#140, #146)
- **Channels**: add people to a channel; guests and moderators get the rights their role names; a members panel to add people, appoint moderators, leave and archive. (#130, #131)
- **Mentions**: `@channel` and `@here` reach the members they address, and notifications follow each member's preference. (#127, #129)
- **Search**: filters by author, date range and attachment, search by file name, and pages that follow relevance instead of skipping or repeating results. (#132)
- **Custom status** with an emoji and an expiry, shown live in messages and the member list. (#134)
- **Do not disturb**, with a snooze and weekly quiet hours. (#135)
- **Data export**: an admin export of messages and files, run as a background job. (#136)
- **Display size** setting, from Large to Dense. (#138)

### Changed
- Runs on Barbacane 0.12.2 (from 0.6.3): plugin manifests, the standalone image, CI and the Makefile. The gateway forwards only the request headers an operation declares, so `specs/burst-s3.yaml` declares the `X-Storage-Key` scheme and `specs/burst-api.yaml` the incoming-webhook bearer scheme. (#98, #101, #137, #141)
- Gateway processes run with `BARBACANE_ALLOW_INTERNAL_EGRESS=true`, since every Burst upstream is a private address.
- The server believes the identity headers only from a trusted peer (`auth.trusted_proxies`). (#103)
- Every documented `BURST_*` variable is read, the event broker included. (#139)
- The web and all-in-one images build the UI on Node 24.

### Fixed
- File uploads larger than about 750 KB are stored instead of failing with 500 (Barbacane 0.12.2 hashes the body on the host).
- The storage gateway accepts any file type.
- First-login provisioning is idempotent, and the groups re-sync no longer undoes a role an admin set. (#105, #112)
- The Docker images generate a valid `env.js` and never pass the gateway an empty issuer override.
- The sidebar footer lines up with the message composer.

## [0.0.7] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- `groups_claim` in OIDC config is now configurable via `BURST_OIDC_GROUPS_CLAIM` env var (was hardcoded to `roles`)
- Defaults to `roles` for backwards compatibility; set to `groups` for Authelia or any provider-specific claim name
- OIDC docs updated with Authelia setup guide and provider comparison table

### Fixed
- Release workflow: reverted `action-gh-release` from v3 to v2 (v3 tag does not exist)

## [0.0.6] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- Incoming webhooks — external systems can post messages to channels via `POST /api/webhooks/{id}/trigger` with bearer token auth (bypasses OIDC)
- Outgoing webhooks — channel events delivered to external URLs with HMAC-SHA256 signing (`X-Burst-Signature`), retry with exponential backoff
- Webhook CRUD endpoints — create, list, get, update, delete, regenerate token (channel-scoped)
- Bot user accounts — `POST /api/admin/bots` creates users with `is_bot=true`, credentials managed by Barbacane `apikey-auth` plugin
- `integrator` role — can manage webhooks and bots without full admin access
- `IntegrationUser` extractor — accepts `admin` or `integrator` roles for integration management endpoints
- Admin panel: Webhooks tab — list all webhooks, create form with channel selector, kind/status display, trigger URL for incoming
- Admin panel: Bots tab — list bots, create form, deactivate
- Integrator mock user (ivy) in dev OIDC server for local testing
- Webhook integration tests (13 tests), bot integration tests (7 tests)
- Webhook/bot E2E tests (6 Playwright tests): tab visibility, webhook creation, trigger delivery, bot creation
- Webhook/bot smoke tests (20 k6 checks): full CRUD, trigger auth, permission checks, bot lifecycle
- Frontend unit tests (6 Vitest tests): tab filtering, webhook list, create form

### Changed
- Admin panel tabs filtered by role: integrators see only Webhooks and Bots; admins see all tabs
- Sidebar admin button visible to both `admin` and `integrator` roles
- Role enum extended: `admin`, `integrator`, `moderator`, `member`, `guest` (was 4 roles, now 5)
- `groups_claim` mapping recognizes `integrator` group from OIDC JWT
- Integration management endpoints use `acl: { allow: [admin, integrator] }` in OpenAPI spec
- `BURST_SPA_BUCKET` env var added to `.env` for local dev

### Fixed
- All-in-one Docker image crash on amd64: switched runtime base from `debian:bookworm-slim` (glibc 2.36) to `debian:trixie-slim` (glibc 2.40) to match CI-built binary (#62)

## [0.0.5] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- OIDC discovery — resolve authorize/token endpoints from `.well-known/openid-configuration` (works with any provider)
- PKCE (S256) for secure public client authentication
- JIT user provisioning maps `preferred_username`, `name`, `email` from OIDC claims
- Role mapping from `x-auth-consumer-groups` header (`admin` group → admin role)

- `LOGIN_LOCAL` env var to hide credentials form when SSO-only
- SPA catch-all route via Barbacane S3 dispatcher with `fallback_key: index.html`
- JIT provisioning integration tests (3 tests) and extractor unit tests (11 tests)

### Changed
- All-in-one image: removed nginx and s6-overlay, replaced with shell entrypoint (4 → 3 processes)
- All-in-one image: SPA served from RustFS via Barbacane S3 dispatcher (was nginx static files)
- All-in-one image: SPA uploaded to RustFS at container startup via `curl --aws-sigv4`
- Bumped Barbacane from v0.6.1 to v0.6.3
- Login button: generic "Sign in with SSO" (was Google-specific)
- Default OIDC scopes: `openid email profile groups` (added `groups`)
- Username set from `preferred_username` claim (was UUID `sub`)

### Removed
- nginx from all-in-one Docker image
- s6-overlay process supervisor from all-in-one Docker image
- Google-specific OIDC endpoint hardcoding

## [0.0.4] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- All-in-one Docker image (`burst-aio`) bundling nginx, Barbacane gateway, S3 sidecar, and Burst API in a single container via s6-overlay
- Runtime OIDC configuration for Docker images via `/env.js` injection — no rebuild needed to change OIDC provider
- OIDC frontend tests (7 tests covering runtime injection, precedence, and defaults)

### Changed
- All API routes now use explicit `/api` prefix end-to-end (spec, gateway, backend, proxy)
- Dispatch `path` overrides removed from OpenAPI spec (paths match end-to-end)
- nginx no longer strips `/api` prefix (direct pass-through to Barbacane)
- Vite dev proxy forwards `/api` requests as-is (no rewrite)
- Bumped Barbacane from v0.5.1 to v0.6.1
- CI: single build job shares artifacts (eliminates 3 redundant Rust compilations)
